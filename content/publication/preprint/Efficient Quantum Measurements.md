abstract: Quantum information processing is limited, in practice, to efficiently implementable operations. This motivates the study of quantum divergences that preserve their operational meaning while faithfully capturing these computational constraints. Using geometric, computational, and information theoretic tools, we define two new types of computational divergences, which we term computational max-divergence and computational measured Rényi divergences. Both are constrained by a family of efficient binary measurements, and thus useful for state discrimination tasks in the computational setting. We prove that, in the infinite-order limit, the computational measured Rényi divergence coincides with the computational max-divergence, mirroring the corresponding relation in the unconstrained information-theoretic setting. For the many-copy regime, we introduce regularized versions and establish a one-sided computational Stein bound on achievable hypothesis-testing exponents under efficient measurements, giving the regularized computational measured relative entropy an operational meaning. We further define resource measures induced by our computational divergences and prove an asymptotic continuity bound for the computational measured relative entropy of resource. Focusing on entanglement, we relate our results to previously proposed computational entanglement measures and provide explicit separations from the information-theoretic setting. Together, these results provide a principled, cohesive approach towards state discrimination tasks and resource quantification under computational constraints.
